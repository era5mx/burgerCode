## burgerCode

The application was initially created by **Antoine HAMOUI**, using [php](http:php.net), [mysql](https://www.mysql.com) and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

This modification made by [David Rengifo](http://david.rengifo.mx) to update the frameworks JQuery 3.3.1 and Bootstrap 3.4.1 besides incorporating the bilingual capacity (English - Spanish) and include some other improvements.

If you find any bug, and a fix for that bug, please leave a comment on the github page for this project and i will push the change into the master branch.
