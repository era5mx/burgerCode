## burgerCode

The application was initially created by **Antoine HAMOUI**, using [php](http:php.net), [mysql](https://www.mysql.com) and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

This modification made by [David Rengifo](http://david.rengifo.mx) to update the frameworks JQuery 3.3.1 and Bootstrap 3.4.1 besides incorporating the bilingual capacity (English - Spanish) and include some other improvements.

If you find any bug, and a fix for that bug, please leave a comment on the github page for this project and i will push the change into the master branch.

### Installing this application is fairly easy, just follow these steps:
****

1. Download the latest version with git (`git clone https://github.com/era5mx/burgerCode.git`)

2. Import/load burgercode_fini.sql into your mysql database. This should set up the basic structure of the database system.

3. Modify the admin/database.php and change the variables to match your host, port, database name, username and passwords.

4. Modify the includes/config.php and define the application configuration.

5. Good luck!
